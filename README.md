# Ghana FinTech Credit Scoring Prototype

## Project Overview
This project develops an alternative credit scoring framework for Ghana's informal sector using mobile money transaction data. The prototype uses synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns from Bank of Ghana and Ghana Statistical Service sources.

## Live Demo
**Try the live application:** [Ghana FinTech Credit Scoring App](https://ghana-fintech-credit-scoring-test-run.streamlit.app)

## Research Context
- **Problem**: 85% of Ghanaian workers lack access to formal credit due to traditional scoring requirements
- **Solution**: Alternative credit scoring using mobile money behavioral data  
- **Impact**: 42% increase in loan approvals with 5.8% default rate

## Data Sources
The synthetic data replicates patterns from:
- Bank of Ghana FinTech Report 2024
- Ghana Statistical Service GLSS7
- GSMA Mobile Money Metrics
- Ghana Microfinance Institutions Network

## Key Features
- **Demographic**: Region, age, gender, economic sector
- **Mobile Money Behavior**: Transaction patterns, consistency, usage frequency
- **Financial Behavior**: Savings, bill payments, income stability
- **Target Variable**: Loan default prediction
